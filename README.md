# Key Features
1. Automatic Timestamp Saving: The add-on automatically saves your current playback position every 5 seconds once youâ€™ve watched for more than 10 seconds, so you never have to worry about losing your place.
2. Seamless Resuming: When you return to a video, it checks for a saved timestamp and resumes playback from that exact moment, making it easy to continue watching without hassle.
